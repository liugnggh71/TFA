dbaascli is a command line interface for different tools to be used with Oracle Cloud DB.
This command line interface supports logging, command history and autocomplete.
Logging is done on a session level. Each time dbaascli is run the last log is overwritten.
To access command history use the up/down arrow keys as you would normally do in a terminal.
Autocomplete uses the Tab key. Autocomplete will complete to the longest common string in case there is not an exact match.
To obtain help on a command use the help keyword at the begining or end.
Autocomplete is supported if the first word is the "help" keyword.
Special commands are available.
The list of special commands is:

    --BUILD     -   Display DBaaS tools build date
    --VERSION   -   Display DBaaS tools version number
    -B          -   Display DBaaS tools build date
    -H
    -HELP
    -V          -   Display DBaaS tools version number
    ?           -   Get dbaascli help
    CLEAR       -   Clear the screen
    HELP        -   Get dbaascli help
    HIST        -   Print command line history
    HISTORY     -   Print command line history
    LIST        -   List available commands
    Q           -   Exit Command Line Interface
    QUIT        -   Exit Command Line Interface


Only in ECS you must specify the dbname as an additional parameter for all commands:

    --dbname <dbname>   -   where <dbname> is the name of the instance that you want to work with.
